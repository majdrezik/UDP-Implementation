# UDP-Implementation
Basic UDP implementation of Client and Server

#How it works:
  1. Export each file as a Runnable JAR File.
    1.2. Save them on Desktop. (e.g. Client.jar , Server.jar)
  2. Open CMD twice. (1 for Client and 1 for Server)
  3. Run each file independently.
  #How To Run The JAR Files?
    3.1. Navigate to your Desktop (cd Desktop)
    3.2. Run this command on first cmd: java -jar "fileName1".jar (i.e. if your file is called Client.jar: java -jar Client.jar).
    3.3. Run this command on 2nd cmd: java -jar "fileName2".jar (i.e. if your file is called Server.jar: java -jar Server.jar).
  4. Send messages to server. type "bye" to exit.
